# CircPePred

A Novel Method for Predicting circRNA-encoded Peptides (circPEPs) using Class-imbalanced Learning Framework (CircPePred)

It consists of two parts: feature representation and a class-imbalanced learning framework. 

Firstly, feature representation is to extract different features. 

Then, a class-imbalanced learning framework is to balance data, and complete the classification task.
